/*In IRC (Internet Relay Chat), server implementations may have their own specific rules and restrictions regarding channel and nickname naming, but generally, 
the following characters are commonly disallowed or restricted:
Space: Spaces are not allowed in channel names, nicknames, or usernames. 
Channels and nicks are usually separated by spaces, so including a space in any of them would cause parsing issues.

Control Characters: Control characters, such as ASCII control characters (e.g., ASCII 0-31), 
are typically not allowed in channel names, nicknames, or usernames. 
These characters are often used for special control functions in IRC clients and servers.

Special IRC Characters: Some IRC networks disallow certain special characters in channel names or nicknames, 
like: #, &, +, !, @, and %, as these characters often have special meanings in IRC.

Non-Printable Characters: Non-printable characters, including some Unicode characters and emojis, 
may be restricted or filtered by IRC servers to prevent misuse or abuse.

Punctuation: Some IRC servers may disallow certain punctuation marks or symbols, 
such as slashes (/), backslashes (), asterisks (*), and question marks (?), to prevent potential command injection or confusion.

Extended Characters: Extended or non-ASCII characters may not be supported universally 
or may be restricted in IRC names depending on the server's configuration and character encoding settings.*/
